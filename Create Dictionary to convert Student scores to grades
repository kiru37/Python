You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores. 
Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names as keys and their assessed grades for values. 
This is the scoring criteria: 
- Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding" 
- Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations" 
- Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable" 
- Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail" 


student_scores = {
    'Harry': 88,
    'Ron': 78,
    'Hermione': 95,
    'Draco': 75,
    'Neville': 60
}

student_grades ={}
for student in student_scores:
   score=student_scores[student]
   if score <= 70:
       student_grades[student]="Fail"
   elif score > 70 and score <= 80:
       student_grades[student]="Acceptable"
   elif score > 80 and score <= 90:
       student_grades[student]="Exceeds Expectations"
   elif score > 90 and score <= 100:
       student_grades[student]="Outstanding"
   else:
       print("enter the valid input")

print(student_grades)
